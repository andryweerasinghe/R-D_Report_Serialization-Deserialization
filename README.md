    Introduction

Serialization and Deserialization are processes used in computing to convert data structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted and reconstructed. In simple terms, Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream while in deserialization an object is reconstructed back from the sequence of bytes. In Java,  these two aspects play a great role in the transfer of data and saving it to a database or disk. 

    What is Serialization?

In Java, an object possesses three distinct properties: State: It expresses the object's value or data. Behavior: An object's behavior provides information about its functionality. Identity: As the name implies, it aids in determining an object's unique identity. By definition, serialization is the process of transforming an object's state into a stream of bytes so that it may be sent or stored to a file, database, or memory.

When an object in Java is no longer needed, the garbage collector removes it from memory where it was initially placed. This item needs to be in an encrypted and suitable format if it is going to be transferredâ€”for instance, across a network. The object must be converted into a byte stream in order to be used for this.

It's important to keep in mind that the byte stream is platform-independent, meaning that an object can be serialized on one platform and then restored to its original state on any other platform.

    What is Deserialization?

To put it exactly like this, deserialization is the reverse of serialization. It is the exact opposite procedure. Deserialization, then, is the process of returning an object to its initial state from a stream of bytes. Java has the ObjectInputStream class, which is the reverse of the ObjectOutputStream we looked at for serialization, to facilitate deserialization. Let's discuss this class's teaching strategies.

    Why do we need Java Serialization?

1. Communication: Objects can be designed, shared, and executed simultaneously by various systems thanks to the conversion of objects into byte streams, which facilitates transfer via networks.
2. Persistence: Any object's current state can be readily saved in a database and retrieved whenever needed.
3. Cloning: It simplifies the cloning process by enabling the creation of an exact duplicate of an object by serialization into a bit stream and subsequent conversion back to the original form.
4. Time Saving: Compared to building a real object from a class, converting a byte stream to an object takes a lot less time.


    Benefits of Deserialization

1. Instead of really generating an object from class, which takes a lot of time, it assists in reconstructing the object from the byte stream.
2. Customizing it is easy.
3. A built-in Java capability that doesn't require any additional software.
